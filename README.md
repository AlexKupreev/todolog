# Basic TODO application

This project started to make simple TODO app with logging possibilities.
But it is also a sandbox for playing with [Clean Code Achitecture](http://blog.8thlight.com/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html).
And one more thing: I'll try to build it without any framework, only with reusable components.
